- No library except for React was used to create this simulation.
- You can view the project [here](https://self-driving-typescript.vercel.app/)
## AI training details
- The AI uses a neural network. 
- The network is trained using a genetic algorithm. 
- The 5 best AI with the highest fitness score is used to generate the next set of AI. 
- The fitness score measures how far into traffic the AI travels.
